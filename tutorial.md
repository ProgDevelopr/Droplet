Start by creating a new Python file that isn't named "droplet.py", and typing:
import droplet
You can set the name with the "as" keyword!

We rigth now have 3 methods:

- listsort()

listsort(), sorts and removes duplicates of a list!

- count()

count(), counts the amount of elements of a list!

- sortcount()

sortcount(), sorts a list and then counts the amount of elements in a list!
